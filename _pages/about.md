[test / do not distribute]

I am Jianhai Shu, a junior undergraduate student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University. I'm currently pursuing a double major in <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgba(224,128,128,1)">Mathematics and Physics</span> and <span style="font-style:italic; color:rgba(224,128,128,1)">Energy and Power Engineering</span>.

I am keen on applied mathematics/statistics, and my research interests include generative models, reinforcement learning, and data-driven control. I hope to leverage advanced mathematical insights and solid engineering background to bridge theory and application, making innovative solutions real-world problems.
